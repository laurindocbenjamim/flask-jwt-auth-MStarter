And the sad fact is that slavery has been a universal institution for thousands of years
as far back as you can trace human history.
And what we're looking at is if slavery is something that happened to one race of people
in one country, when in fact the spread of it was around the world.
And 1776, which is when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nation as well as when the
United States got started, he said that Western Europe is the only place in the world where
there is no slavery.
And even in the Western Europeans had vast numbers of slaves in the West and Hemisphere,
but not in the Western Europe itself.
And so if you're going to have reparations for slavery, it's going to be the greatest
transfer of wealth back and forth.
And cross-hauling as they say in the real Rose, because the number of whites, for example,
who were enslaved in North Africa by the barbaric pirates exceeded the number of Africans
enslaved in the United States and in the American colonies before that put together.
But nobody is going to know what the Africa is to ask for reparations because nobody is
going to be fool enough to give it to them.
And we have intellectuals who can imagine a different history from the rest of the world,
even though it's so similar to the rest of the world.
Let that sink in, not as an excuse, not as a justification for any atrocity, but as
a baseline reality check against the simplistic morality plays that pass for history today.
The insistence on viewing the tragic history of slavery solely through the lens of the transatlantic
slave trade, focusing exclusively on white perpetrators and black victims is a dangerous
distortion.
It's a distortion that serves contemporary political agendas, not historical truth.
To understand slavery, and particularly the role various peoples, including Africans,
played in it, requires us to discard the blinders and confront the uncomfortable, complex,
and universal reality of this institution.
This deliberately challenges a narrative that dominates modern discourse, the idea that
slavery was a unique evil invented by Europeans and inflicted solely upon Africans.
This prevailing view, while emotionally potent and politically convenient, crumbles under
the weight of historical fact.
It's a story built on selective focus, ignoring the near-universal practice of slavery across
cultures and millennia, including its deep roots within Africa itself before the transatlantic
trade began.
To insist on the simplistic tale of unique European guilt is not just an error, it's
a refusal to confront the comprehensive, often uncomfortable, history of human bondage.
As I've said before in the evidence's mountainous, the first hard fact one must grasp a fact
documented in countless volumes like those lining my own shelves is the sheer universality
of slavery.
This wasn't an invention sprung from the minds of 15th century Portuguese navigators or
English colonists.
It was, for the vast majority of recorded human history, the norm, not the exception.
Freedom, as we understand it, was the rare and precarious condition.
Look anywhere on the globe.
At any period before the last few centuries, and you find slavery in myriad forms.
The Romans built an empire on the backs of slaves captured from across Europe, North Africa,
and the Near East.
Britons, Gauls, Germans, Syrians, Jews.
Were the Romans enslaving based on a modern conception of race?
Of course not.
They enslaved whomever they could conquer.
The Greeks celebrated for their contributions to democracy and philosophy, practiced widespread
slavery, often enslaving other Greeks.
In ancient Egypt, Pharaoh's utilized slave labor drawn from Nubia and war captives.
Travel East, slavery was integral to economies and societies in China, India, Korea, and
Southeast Asia for centuries, often involving debt bondage, the sale of children, or the
enslavement of specific ethnic minorities or aboriginal groups.
As empires in the Americas, the Aztecs, the Maya, the Inca, practiced slavery, primarily
taking captives in warfare, long before Columbus set sail.
The Ottoman Empire relied heavily on slaves drawn from Eastern Europe.
The Balkans providing the infamous Dev Shurmelevi for Janissaries, the Caucasus, Circassians,
and Africa.
The very word slave in English derives from Slav, reflecting the vast numbers of Slavic peoples
enslaved by various groups, including Vikings and Ottomans over centuries.
The point isn't to create a what aboutism contest of suffering.
It is to establish the fundamental baseline.
Slavery was a human institution, practiced by humans of virtually every conceivable background
against other humans, usually those who were weaker, different, or defeated.
It was driven by brute economics, power dynamics, and the grim realities of pre-modern warfare
and social structures.
To single out one group as uniquely culpable, or another as uniquely victimized in the
grand sweep of history, is not just wrong, it's intellectually dishonest.
It requires ignoring the overwhelming weight of evidence from across the globe and throughout
time.
The narrative of unique European guilt relies on cropping the historical photo, cutting
out 90% of the picture to focus on the part that fits a preconceived ideological frame.
Now let's turn to Africa itself, long before the first European ships arrive seeking captives
for the Americas.
The romanticized notion of idyllic, egalitarian African societies shattered by external evil
is just that.
A romance.
A myth.
Slavery was deeply embedded in the social, economic, and political fabric of numerous African
societies.
Sources from Arab travelers centuries ago to later European explorers and the oral
histories of African peoples themselves confirmed this reality.
Slavery within Africa took many forms.
People became slaves through capture and warfare between different kingdoms or ethnic groups,
a primary source.
They could fall into slavery due to debt as punishment for crimes or be sold by their own
families during times of famine.
In many societies, slaves were a measure of wealth and status, used for agricultural labor,
domestic service, military service, and even human sacrifice in some instances.
Crucially, when European traders arrived on the West African coast, they did not for the
most part venture inland to capture slaves themselves.
The climate, diseases, and resistance from organized African states made large-scale
European raiding expeditions impractical and dangerous.
Instead, they tapped into pre-existing networks of enslavement and trade run by Africans.
European merchants established trading posts, factories on the coast, and purchased enslaved
individuals from powerful African rulers and middlemen who controlled the interior.
Helms like Dahome, Asante, Ashanti, Oyo, and the Congo grew immensely powerful and wealthy,
precisely because of their role in capturing and selling other Africans.
These were sophisticated organized states with armies, complex political structures, and
extensive trade networks.
Their rulers engaged in warfare specifically to acquire captives for sale.
The negotiated prices, demanded specific trade goods, textiles, metals, alcohol, firearms,
rich further fueled warfare and slave raiding, and controlled the flow of captives to the
coast.
Does this diminish the horrors of the middle passage, or the brutality of chattel slavery in
the Americas?
Not in the slightest, but it fundamentally challenges the simplistic narrative.
It reveals that Africans were not merely passive victims, but active participants, rulers,
traders, and enslavers within this horrific system, often profiting immensely from it.
To ignore this reality is to infanalyze Africans, denying them agency even in the context of
these brutal historical processes.
It treats an entire continent and its diverse peoples as a monolithic block of victims, erasing
the complex histories of power, warfare, and economic activity, including slave trading,
that characterize the continent for centuries.
During this participation is essential for a truthful understanding, moving beyond the
mannequin tail of pure white evil versus pure black innocence.
The selective historical focus becomes even more apparent when we consider the widespread
enslavement of Europeans.
As mentioned in the opening clip, the Barbary Pirates of North Africa represent a stark
counter-narrative often conveniently omitted.
From roughly the 16th to the early 19th century, corsairs sailing from Al-Jeeer's, Tunis,
Tripoli, and Morocco, raided ships and coastal towns across the Mediterranean and even far
into the Atlantic.
Their targets were primarily Europeans, Spanish, Italians, French, Portuguese, English, Irish,
Dutch, Scandinavians, and even Icelanders.
They captured sailors, fishermen, merchants, passengers, and villagers, dragging them
back to North African ports to be sold in slave markets.
The estimate suggests that well over a million Europeans were enslaved during this period.
Historian Robert Davis in his book Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters, meticulously calculated
figures suggesting between 1 million and 1.25 million Europeans were enslaved between
1530 and 1780 alone.
This number, as noted, exceeds the estimated number of Africans brought to the territory
that became the United States.
These European slaves faced brutal conditions.
Many men were condemned to labor as galley slaves, chained to oars on the corsairships
under horrific circumstances.
Others were put to work in quarries, construction projects, or agriculture.
Women often ended up in heroms or as domestic servants.
Conditions were harsh, life expectancy was often short, and escape was nearly impossible.
Women was a possibility for some, leading to extensive efforts by European states and
religious orders like the Trinitarians and Mercidarians, dedicated to fundraising and negotiating
the release of captives.
Even the fledgling United States fought its first foreign wars, the Barbury Wars, precisely
to stop this piracy and enslavement of American sailors and the demand for tribute payments.
Why is this vast chapter of enslavement so often downplayed or ignored in popular
discussions?
Because it fundamentally disrupts the simplistic racial narrative, it demonstrates unequivocally
that slavery crossed racial and religious lines, North African Muslims enslaved European
Christians, whites were victims on a massive scale.
The numbers involved were enormous, comparable to or exceeding aspects of the transatlantic
trade often highlighted.
Power dynamics, not race, were key.
The Barbury states, possessing naval power in the Mediterranean at the time, enslaved
those they could overpower, just as other groups did elsewhere.
This isn't about equating different forms of slavery or diminishing the unique horrors
of the hereditary chattel slavery system that developed in the Americas.
It is about historical accuracy and context.
If the discussion is about the history of slavery and who participated, the enslavement
of over a million Europeans by North Africans is a fact of monumental significance that cannot
be swept under the rug to maintain a politically convenient narrative of one-way racial oppression.
Its omission speaks volumes about the purpose behind much contemporary discourse on slavery,
which often seems less about understanding history and more about assigning collective
hereditary guilt in the present.
Given the near-universal prevalence of slavery throughout history and across cultures,
what stands out as truly remarkable and historically unique is not its existence, but its abolition.
And the uncomfortable fact for many is that the movement to abolish slavery originated
and gained critical momentum primarily within Western civilization, particularly in 18th
and 19th century Britain.
For millennia, slavery was largely unquestioned, seen as a natural part of the social order,
ordained by fate, gods, or the right of conquest.
While individual philosophers or religious texts might express reservations or call for
humane treatment, the institution itself was rarely fundamentally challenged on a societal
level.
The shift began with enlightenment ideas about universal human rights and crucially with
religious movements, especially among quakers and evangelical Christians in Britain and
America.
Figures like Granville Sharp, Thomas Clarkson, and William Wilberforce spearheaded a moral
crusade against the slave trade and then slavery itself.
This was not an easy or popular cause initially.
It fought against powerful vested economic interests tied to colonial plantations and shipping.
Yet this movement achieved something unprecedented.
Britain abolished the slave trade in 1807.
This wasn't just a domestic decree, Britain actively sought to suppress the trade internationally.
The Royal Navy's West Africa Squadron.
For decades, Britain dedicated significant naval resources, a substantial portion of
its fleet to patrolling the African coast, intercepting slave ships, including those from
America, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, and Africa itself, and freeing captives.
This cost British taxpayers immense sums and cost the lives of thousands of British sailors
to disease and combat.
It was a costly moral undertaking with little direct economic benefit to Britain.
Britain abolished slavery throughout its empire in 1833, compensating slave owners, a morally
questionable but politically necessary step to achieve passage at enormous national expense.
Other Western nations followed, pressured by Britain, internal abolitionist movements,
and changing economic and moral landscapes, though often with great resistance as seen
in the American Civil War.
Contrast this with the rest of the world.
While the West was undergoing this painful and costly process of abolition, slavery continued
unabated in much of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.
In many cases, it was only ended later due to direct Western colonial pressure or intervention.
Saudi Arabia and Yemen didn't formally abolish slavery until the 1960s.
Britannia didn't criminalize it until 2007, and vestiges reportedly persist.
The historical irony is profound, the very civilization often castigated as the sole villain in the
slavery narrative was also the primary engine for its global destruction.
Slavery ended, not because it collapsed everywhere simultaneously, but because one part of the
world, Western civilization, developed a unique moral conviction against it and possessed
the power and will, however imperfectly applied to enforce that conviction, first upon itself
and then upon others, to ignore this is to ignore the most historically significant development
in the entire saga of human bondage.
This brings us back to the contemporary demands for reparations, often framed as in the
Ta-Nehisi quotes, quote mentioned earlier, as a national reckoning for America's original
sin, leading to spiritual renewal.
From a perspective grounded in historical fact and logical consistency, this entire framework
is deeply flawed, bordering on the absurd.
Consider the practicalities, the basic arithmetic, who pays should descendants of white abolitionists
pay, descendants of union soldiers who died fighting the Confederacy, descendants of immigrants
who arrived long after slavery ended, descendants of the majority of white southerners who never
owned slaves, collective guilt assigned by race and history is illogical and unjust.
Who receives?
How does one prove dissent specifically from slaves?
Given intermarriage and the complexities of ancestry, this is fraught with difficulty.
What about descendants of free blacks who themselves own slaves, a documented historical fact
in places like Charleston and New Orleans?
What about descendants of Africans who sold people into slavery?
What about descendants of the million-plus Europeans enslaved by barbaric pirates?
Should they seek reparations from North African nations, calculating the debt?
How can the suffering of generations past be calculated and monetized?
How are centuries of subsequent history, including massive social programs, civil rights legislation
and economic progress, however uneven, factored in?
The entire premise rests on the false, historically myopic foundation that American slavery was
a unique event perpetrated solely by one easily identifiable group, whites, against another
blacks, whose consequences can be neatly isolated and rectified centuries later.
But as we've seen, slavery was universal, not unique.
Africans actively participated in enslaving other Africans for the transatlantic trade.
Europeans were also enslaved on a massive scale by non-Europeans, the abolition movement
that ended slavery was primarily Western.
In these facts, the reparations argument collapses under the weight of historical complexity
and logical inconsistency.
It becomes clear that the demand is not truly about rectifying quantifiable damages based
on sound historical accounting.
It is rather a political project aimed at leveraging historical grievances, selectively
presented to extract resources and power in the present, predicated on fostering a sense
of collective inherited guilt among one group and inherited victimhood among another.
The spiritual renewal sought is not one based on truth, but on the exorcism of a fabricated
historical demon through the sacrifice of contemporary resources and principles of individual
responsibility.
It's the kind of intellectual slide of hand that sounds profound in elite journals,
but evaporates upon contact with basic facts and common sense.
Slide is confronting the full complex history of slavery matter so much because the distorted
simplistic narrative has consequences.
It fosters intergroup resentment, constantly portraying one group as uniquely villainous
and another as uniquely victimized while ignoring countervailing facts, breeds animosity
and hinders social cohesion.
It encourages people to see themselves and others through the lens of group identity and
historical grievance rather than as individuals.
It leads to bad policy.
Policies based on false premises rarely succeed.
Reparations, certain forms of affirmative action predicated on vague notions of systemic
injustice rather than specific discriminatory acts.
An educational curricula focused on assigning collective guilt are all likely to fail or
backfire precisely because they misdiagnose the historical reality and the present situation.
It obscures real problems by attributing all disparities or difficulties faced by black
Americans today solely to the legacy of slavery or ongoing systemic racism, often vaguely defined.
We ignore other complex factors, cultural patterns, family structures, educational failures,
counterproductive political ideologies that may be far more relevant to contemporary challenges
and amenable to different solutions.
It undermines genuine achievement.
It implicitly teaches that victimhood is identity and that group grievance is the path
to progress rather than emphasizing individual effort, responsibility, education and resilience,
the factors that have allowed individuals from all backgrounds including those who faced
enormous historical adversity to succeed.
Ignoring the universality of slavery, the role of Africans in the trade, the enslavement
of Europeans and the Western origins of abolitionism isn't just bad history, it's poisoned to
clear thinking and constructive action in the present.
It allows intellectuals and activists like those I mentioned who seem determined to imagine
a different history for America, to build elaborate edifices of grievance and demand upon
foundations of sand.
The history of slavery is a brutal tragic story that spans millennia and touches nearly
every society on earth.
It was not invented by white people nor were black people at soul victims, Africans enslaved
other Africans, North Africans enslaved Europeans, Asians enslaved Asians, Native Americans
enslaved Native Americans.
Europeans participated heavily, particularly in the transatlantic trade, but also eventually
led the charge to abolish the institution globally at great cost.
These are the hard, uncomfortable facts stripped of the emotional overlay and political agendas
that dominate so much contemporary discussion.
The currently fashionable narrative, a tale of singular white guilt and passive black
victimhood, is a dangerous fiction.
It requires ignoring vast swathes of global history, including the agency and participation
of Africans in the slave trade and the extensive enslavement of Europeans.
Demands for reparations based on this fiction are not just impractical.
They are intellectually bankrupt and morally questionable, seeking to impose collective,
inherited guilt based on a selective and distorted reading of the past.
The reckoning demanded is often a reckoning with a phantom designed to serve present day
political goals rather than historical truth.
Creating the true history of slavery in all its global complexity and uncomfortable truths
doesn't excuse any specific atrocity, but it does inoculate us against the simplistic
blame assigning narratives that do so much damage.
It allows us to see the past more clearly and perhaps to navigate the present with a
firmer grasp on reality, rather than being led astray by those who prefer comforting myths
and convenient villains.
We is not a morality play to be cast according to today's political wins.
It is a complex tapestry of human action often brutal and tragic that we must strive to
understand in its entirety, not just selectively sample for ideological ammunition.
Only by facing the full reality, however unpleasant, can we hope to learn
