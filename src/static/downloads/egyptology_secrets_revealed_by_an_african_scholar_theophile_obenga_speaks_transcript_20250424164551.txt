Geographically speaking,
So let's dismiss that geographical argument.
Now, worthy Egyptians black.
They created this concept of a brown race.
Among all the Mediterranean peoples, only Egyptians were supposedly brown.
The Greeks weren't, the Romans weren't.
But suddenly there is a brown race.
Mellen and Tests were done in Liverpool and Manchester.
And the results, which were published somewhat secretly,
secretly, clearly show that the Egyptians had dark skin.
The term black was even used in English.
I was embarrassed, so I stopped.
When we went out for drinks that evening, he said,
you're awful.
I replied, no, it's you who's awful, Afro-Asiatic.
He was trying to make a joke with the term Afro-Asiatic.
I told him, you're the one who's awful because you need
to abandon this Afro-Asiatic theory.
It was all friendly, but at the same time, it was technical,
and a bit awkward, but in good faith.
When he got back to the United States, he changed his view
and admitted, we were wrong.
But the others didn't change.
They continued to push this theory.
They even fought back, bringing together 49 authors
to produce a 400-page book attacking Sheikh Antadiyop
and others.
The word Egypt is Greek.
The Ramses and the Pharaohs didn't know the term Egypt.
They called their country Tawi, meaning our land.
They referred to their land as chemit, the black land,
not because of the soil, but because the people
who lived there were black.
They identified themselves as black, calling themselves
chemtue, meaning the black people in contrast
to the Mediterranean whites and Asians.
This shows that they had a clear sense
of their own identity as black people.
This erasure of history is why the West often struggles
with its conscience when it comes to Africa.
They can't love Africa because they know what they've done.
And this has led to the falsification of African history
as Sheikh Antadiyop often pointed out.
They claim Africans have no history
because acknowledging it would be too contradictory
to their narrative.
Until the lions have their own historians,
the tales of the hunt will always glorify the hunter.
Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, I feel completely at ease
as many memories are flooding back.
I remember when we were at a meeting in Wagadugu,
greeting President Sankara and the guests.
Of course, he didn't know me at the time.
It was the first time we met.
I introduced myself and he said, hey you, we need to talk.
I replied, Mr. President, the schedule is tight.
But he insisted, no, we'll talk tomorrow
when we lay the railway tracks.
When we arrived, we were tasked
with laying the railway tracks toward Ivory Coast.
I said, but we're not engineers.
How are we going to lay tracks where the train will pass?
And he said, don't worry, we need African creativity.
That memory stayed with me, almost as if we were brothers
or close friends, even though he was the president.
His simplicity and familiarity immediately put you at ease,
which is rare for someone in power.
So when we see you, Madam,
it's hard to find the right words to express ourselves.
You can probably guess what we are trying to say
through our silence.
Earlier, before breakfast,
Madam gave a brilliant presentation on scientific research
and the atmosphere in the room was incredible.
We all share the same vision, the same words,
the same enthusiasm and the same faith.
Let me share another story.
I was in Washington with some friends
and we decided to go to a hotel.
It was winter and Maya Angelou arrived without a coat
while I had my warm Parisian coat.
She asked, give me your coat, I'm cold and so I did.
She wore it throughout the evening
when it was time to leave, I joked, that's my only coat.
She smiled and gave it back to me at the door of her hotel room.
Maya Angelou was an extraordinary woman,
tall with a great spirit, dedicated and incredibly simple.
That simplicity is something I've seen in great people.
I found the same simplicity in shake and to deop,
even though he was much older and more knowledgeable than me.
He always listened to me, even when I offered
what I thought were naive opinions.
He never dismissed them.
Truly, great minds have welcoming spirits.
The second point I want to emphasize quickly
is about Egyptology.
Egyptology is essentially a specialization of history.
It is the study of ancient Egyptian history,
particularly during the Faryonic era.
This Faryonic Egypt lasted for around 35 centuries
to give some perspective if you count the years of French history
from Clovis to François Hollande.
It's not even 20 centuries.
But Egypt lasted 35 centuries
with indigenous local national pharaohs ruling the country.
This African kingdom was located along the Lower Nile Valley
in East Africa, in the northeastern part of the continent,
with the Nile flowing into the Mediterranean.
So geographically, it was an African region.
But now they want to remove that fact
and call it part of the Near East.
What exactly is the geographic location of the Near East?
No one really knows.
If I'm in Japan, the farthest west is France and England.
But do we call them far west?
Why do we say far east or near east?
We should also say far west, but we don't.
It doesn't make sense.
And this whole terminology is ideological.
Geographically speaking, Faryonic Egypt
was clearly on the African continent.
So let's dismiss that geographical argument.
Now, were the Egyptians black?
They created this concept of a brown race.
Among all the Mediterranean peoples,
only Egyptians were supposedly brown.
The Greeks weren't, the Romans weren't.
But suddenly there's a brown race.
Melon and Tess were done in Liverpool and Manchester.
And the results, which were published somewhat secretly,
clearly show that the Egyptians had dark skin.
The term black was even used in English.
Cheikh Antideop, who asked Professor Monet
to visit his lab in Dakar, conducted melon and dosage tests
and found that the melon and levels were very high.
Professor Bilolo, here with us, studied what Aristotle said.
Aristotle noted that the Egyptians were not just black,
but very black.
And even Herodotus, who visited Egypt and saw the pyramids,
described the people as having black skin and curly hair.
If you live in Africa, have black skin and curly hair,
that should be enough evidence.
If I place a strand of my hair next to a white person's hair
on the table, you can clearly see mine curls while there's
is straight.
That's what we call curly hair, which people now want to straighten.
The ancient Egyptians had black skin, curly hair,
and other features associated with African people,
such as broad noses.
That's enough to be considered black, to be considered African.
This isn't a moral judgment.
It's simply based on physical evidence.
Now people say, yes, the Egyptians were black.
They were in Africa, but they didn't share the same culture.
They argue that the Egyptian language was completely different
from the languages spoken in West, Central, or East Africa.
But this debate has been ongoing since 1844,
when a German scholar, without any proof,
proposed this division.
And because it was written by a German,
it was accepted without question, even
though the argument was overly complicated and frankly false.
Later, they stopped calling it the hermitic language family.
And an American scholar, Grimberg,
suggested the term Afro-Asiatic languages.
These are languages spoken in Africa,
like Berber and Ancient Egyptian, as well as languages
spoken in Asia, like Semitic languages, Hebrew, Babylonian, et cetera.
The Americans accepted this without question
due to their cultural and scientific influence.
But the reality is, many of those who describe African languages
aren't real linguists.
They're simply language describers.
I've had the privilege of studying real linguistics,
and I learned the difference.
At a major conference in Barcelona, I was confronted
by a linguist from Los Angeles, who worked with computers.
He ran a program that compared 1,000 words from Egyptian
with 1,000 words from Semitic languages
and asked the computer to find common roots.
The computer did the work and left many blank spaces
where there were no matches.
When he presented his findings, I said,
I can do better than your computer.
I'll fill in those blanks.
And when I did, it became clear that the computer was right
to leave those spaces blank, because the languages didn't match.
But they insisted on creating this Afro-Asiatic category,
even when the evidence didn't support it.
This entire debate is ideological.
The facts show that ancient Egypt was part of Africa,
that its people were black, and that the connections between Egypt
and other African cultures are much stronger
than some scholars are willing to admit.
And actually, I'm saying this now politely
because I was even embarrassed.
After all, he was a scholar, a colleague,
and I couldn't go too far with my remarks.
I was embarrassed, so I stopped.
When we went out for drinks that evening, he said,
you're awful.
I replied, no, it's you who's awful.
Afro-Asiatic.
He was trying to make a joke with the term Afro-Asiatic.
I told him, you're the one who's awful
because you need to abandon this Afro-Asiatic theory.
It was all friendly, but at the same time,
it was technical and a bit awkward, but in good faith.
When he got back to the United States,
he changed his view and admitted we were wrong.
But the others didn't change.
They continued to push this theory.
They even fought back, bringing together 49 authors
to produce a 400-page book attacking
Chekhan to Diyop and others.
They attacked me, too.
But I said, I will respond not only for myself,
but for the deceased as well.
I will speak for both of us.
It was exhausting.
They didn't even consider Africans as humans
deserving of respect, saying we were nothing more
than monkeys on the banks of the Senn.
They pretended to know, but in reality, they knew nothing.
Not about a cadian, Babylonian, Semitic languages, Hebrew,
Phoenician, Aramaic, the language of Christ, Syriac,
or any of them.
They just threw out terms without real knowledge,
claiming expertise in these languages.
But in fact, they didn't have the true technical understanding,
especially when it comes to ancient Egypt and African languages.
In reality, this whole debate about whether Egypt was black
or African is over, except for the ignorant.
As Madame said, it's already settled.
UNESCO even produced eight volumes of African history.
And in the second volume, they focus on African origins.
I contributed to the part on ancient Egypt.
If I wrote about it and you say this is all Chekhan
to Dieop's work, you need to know that this
has been part of an international debate.
We had a major conference in January and February 1974
with over 20 Egyptologists, including Chekhan to Dieop
and myself.
Even the Senegalese president sent a journalist to report.
The debates were intense, but what did the final reports say?
On the issue of skin color, the report
couldn't refute Herodotus, Aristotle, or the Melanon tests.
They admitted that the fundamental thesis defended
by Chekhan to Dieop in nation's negras eculture
were validated during the international conference.
There were three Africans present, including
a Sudanese professor called Abdullah.
When the debate started Chekhan to Dieop,
mentioned that the term chemit meant black land.
Abdullah stood up and said, no professor Chekhan to Dieop,
you're wrong.
The word chemit doesn't mean black in ancient Egypt.
I was half asleep, but I woke up and thought, wait a minute,
isn't chemit the word for black?
Abdullah insisted on his point.
Even though I respected him as a scholar,
Chekhan to Dieop, who was normally calm,
got a bit irritated and said, listen,
we have the best grammarian here, Professor Sonoran.
If you don't speak up, Obenga and I will leave.
It was a serious moment.
Sonoran confirmed that chemit does indeed mean black.
Afterward, I went to Abdullah and asked,
why did you argue like that when you knew it wasn't
true?
It's ridiculous to contradict just for the sake of it.
Every time he saw me afterward, he'd ask, how is Professor Chek?
And I'd say, he doesn't even greet you.
The word Egypt is Greek.
The Ramses and the Pharaohs didn't know the term Egypt.
They called their country Tawi meaning our land.
They referred to their land as chemit, the black land,
not because of the soil, but because the people who lived there
were black.
They identified themselves as black,
calling themselves chemt you, meaning the black people,
in contrast to the Mediterranean whites and Asians.
This shows that they had a clear sense
of their own identity as black people.
So today, the debate is more or less settled.
Ancient Egypt belongs to the cultural universe of black Africa.
The task now is to study this ancient Egypt, its language,
its Pharaohs, the founders like Nama.
The name Nama actually means electric fish.
A name we still use in Africa today
for something powerful and defensive.
There were queens called sit, meaning the black woman.
The wife of a Pharaoh bore this name, which
translates to the black Egyptian woman, 100% Egyptian.
There were queens who even had private libraries.
One such queen had her own collection of books,
showing how highly educated some women were in ancient Egypt.
Queen Hatshebsut created beauty products and perfumes
with lotus flowers in her own quarters.
This is written clearly.
She made perfumes, including the famous Lotus-centred perfume.
This is not a copy of something from the Greeks,
who didn't have perfumes or incense.
This woman, a Pharaoh, made perfumes, beauty creams,
and lotions in her palace.
There was also a conspiracy where a woman
tried to place her son on the throne alongside a few royal
advisers.
When the plot was uncovered, Pharaoh Ramsey
said, let justice be done.
Take them to court and let the judges decide.
He didn't order their punishment himself,
even though they plotted against him.
He respected the judicial process.
Eventually, some of the conspirators were executed out of shame,
but Ramsey's left it to the courts.
In ancient Egypt, there were no state prisons.
Socrates, a Greek philosopher, for example,
died in a state prison, where he was sentenced to drink
hemlock after a democratic vote for corrupting the youth
and disrespecting the city's gods.
But in Egypt, there was no such thing as a state prison
or deprivation of freedom by the state.
They believed that every human being was sacred,
and imprisoning someone would mean
imprisoning their spiritual entities,
essentially imprisoning the divine within them.
In ancient Egypt, there was punishment for wrongdoing,
but no capital punishment or state imprisonment,
because humans were seen as sacred beings,
connected to the universe through various spiritual elements.
Today, we separate matter and spirit.
The West has chosen a materialistic path.
Faryonic civilization combined both matter and spirit,
and that's why they could build the pyramids,
something we still cannot replicate.
It was a combination of the two,
something beyond just the physical world.
What we now call miracles was natural to them.
Now, Western philosophy, since Descartes,
has focused on reason alone,
dismissing anything beyond that as superstition or black magic.
But the Egyptians understood that there was more,
something that was both matter and spirit at the same time.
This knowledge is what allowed them to accomplish great things,
like building pyramids and preserving bodies for millennia.
Modern attempts, like preserving Lenin or Mao,
haven't been as successful.
This ancient civilization knew how to combine the physical
and spiritual worlds in a way that modern science
has not yet understood.
It's a powerful legacy, one that the rest of the world
now acknowledges.
But as Ames Zer said,
slavery didn't just destroy the body, it destroyed the mind.
It stripped people of their names, their identities,
and their history.
This erasure of history is why the West often struggles
with its conscience when it comes to Africa.
They can't love Africa because they know what they've done.
And this has led to the falsification of African history,
as Sheikh Antadiop often pointed out.
They claim Africans have no history
because acknowledging it would be too contradictory
to their narrative.
As a result, they dismiss everything African.
They mock the continent's development,
point to its poverty, and say that Africa is backward.
But what is really happening in Africa?
Oil spills are polluting the Gulf of Guinea.
Countries are being destabilized by coos.
And these external forces are often behind it all.
No, I believe that in this world,
the Chinese have their own geopolitical strategy.
They are building their country, they have their plans.
They completed the Long March, built the Bamboo Curtain,
developed nuclear power, submarines,
space technology, and their economy.
They fight, develop, and open up.
Now Europe is also building itself into a great power.
They intervene in global affairs,
and you can't easily push them around.
India is also rising.
The Arabs are trying to rebuild
despite the challenges they face.
In Latin America, they tried to build something
like with the ideas of Marco Sol,
but it seems to have fallen apart.
Still, they are also trying to build a union.
The United States are the greatest strategists.
First, they are strong by themselves
as a United country.
Then they work with Mexico and Canada,
creating a second scenario where they're
unite in terms of visas, the dollar, and other matters.
There's free movement between the US and Canada.
In a third scenario, they engage the entire American continent,
including Cuba and South America,
under the banner of the American Congress, which meets regularly.
The US also leads the Atlantic Alliance with NATO,
which DeGauw left, and Sarcosi later rejoined.
While we are located along the Atlantic Ocean,
we are not part of NATO because we are too weak.
The US also plays on the Pacific stage,
engaging with countries like China, Japan, and Korea.
They meet to discuss issues in the Pacific,
but Africa is absent from all these strategic scenarios.
We are not involved in any military, security,
or scientific plans for the future.
So the paths laid out by the founding fathers
are the wrong ones, and they need to be abandoned,
as painful as that may be.
We need to develop the ideas of a federal state.
This is the only solution.
Some say it's too early, others say it's too late,
but it's never too early or too late.
You just do it.
Like the US, where Obama could become president,
because they created a system that allowed it.
It won't end with us.
Future generations will refine and improve the plans.
What Africa needs is not development in the traditional sense,
because we will never be developed
in the way others imagine.
What we need is power, so we can play our own cards
and be autonomous.
It will be difficult, because if Africa asserts its power,
Europe and the West will react violently.
They will try to suppress us with mass killings and detentions,
especially if we refuse to let them exploit our resources
like fishing in Mauritania or oil drilling in our territories.
Look at Uranium.
Arrava is the world's leading nuclear company,
yet there isn't a single grain of Uranium in France.
They get it almost for free from Niger,
but if we had a federal state and claimed control
over our resources,
the West would have to reckon with African power.
They wouldn't be able to exploit us
to strengthen their economies anymore.
We would be building our own strength.
This won't be easy for them to accept,
but it's the only way forward.
Africa has a glorious past, with ancient Egypt,
the Ghana, Marley and Songhai empires,
the Ashanti civilizations, and many others.
There was gold everywhere.
Everything was rich.
The Yerubas, the Igboes, the kingdoms of Congo and Zimbabwe,
these were great powers,
and there was no void in Africa.
In Cameroon, there were powerful leaders and sacred rulers,
just as there were in Egypt and Ethiopia.
Women also held power in Africa.
Queen Zingha in Angola stood against the Portuguese,
leading her troops.
There were powerful female leaders everywhere,
from Senegal to the Ivory Coast.
The women of Africa ruled kingdoms, led armies,
and were scholars and teachers.
They passed on ethics and virtues.
We have immense values and resources
from diamonds to agriculture.
Even Kenya now supplies the world with flowers,
a business once dominated by Holland.
Africa has everything, and now we need to take charge.
Those who want to help us develop our own strength
are welcome, whether they are Chinese, Europeans, or others.
But they must understand that we can no longer be dominated.
We must create a pan-African political party
with chapters all over the continent
to unite the African youth, women, and leaders
under a common vision.
Of course, we will face infiltration
just like the black panthers were infiltrated.
But we need to be prepared for that.
We must develop our own security and intelligence services.
The world no longer functions the way it used to.
We need to rethink how we approach everything
and Madam Sankara's questions.
Where do we come from?
Where are we now?
And where are we going?
Our vital.
Our ancestors left us with a powerful legacy,
and Africa is the cradle of humanity for a reason.
It's not a coincidence that humankind was born in Africa
and spread out to conquer the world.
We have been through slavery, colonization, and exploitation.
But that only strengthens our resolve.
If we remain weak, we will be enslaved again
in this global order.
But if we are strong, we will be respected.
And that respect will extend to all of humanity.
We don't seek to dominate others or wage war.
We love our fellow humans.
Our goal is to build a different, more humane world,
free from exploitation.
As the reservoir of the world's resources, known and unknown,
Africa has the power to help humanity thrive.
So our struggle is not selfish.
It's about building a better world for all.
When Africa rises, the world will benefit from our strength.
Unlike the West, which builds power through domination,
Africa's rise will uplift humanity.
We must reject the Western mindset of domination.
Even in Europe, this mentality of domination
is fracturing their unity with countries like Greece
resisting being controlled by Germany or France.
So let's take these final minutes for discussion.
Earlier, Madame Sankara asked, where do we come from?
Where are we?
Where are we going?
These are the key questions.
In the last 50 or 60 years, Africans
have experienced more than any other people on Earth.
We've had founding fathers who established republics,
lifelong presidents, and single party systems
with one opinion, one slogan, and one party for the entire nation.
We've also had multiple parties, ethnic, family,
and village-based systems.
At one point, there was the Africa of the colonels
where military leaders, after staging coups,
ruled the continent.
They were seen as incorruptible,
and were given the chance to lead.
We've had coups, we've killed leaders,
and we've seen African leadership decapitated.
We paralyzed movements and imprisoned leaders like Mandela,
who spent 27 years in jail just for demanding dignity,
freedom, and equality.
We've gone through popular mobilization
to celebrate African heads of state
with groups cheering and dancing for them as they passed.
We had financial aid projects from institutions
like the World Bank and debt piled up.
Toxic and even nuclear waste was dumped on our coasts,
and people died from it.
But we were told it was our own waste,
not that from foreign nations.
We've seen youth movements, women's mobilization,
and strong unions, all part of Africa's experiences
over the last 50 to 60 years.
Yet despite all these experiences,
Africa remains in debt, poor, and underdeveloped.
We've lived through many slogans,
health for all by 1980, sustainable development,
and now emergence.
But how will we emerge?
No one knows.
Africa has gone through every possible system.
We've had lifelong presidents,
presidents with vice presidents,
countries with multiple presidents and prime ministers.
We were even ahead of Europe
in appointing a female prime minister.
Africa had already named a woman as prime minister
before France did.
What haven't we tried?
Koo's, civil wars, national conferences.
We've done it all.
But Africa remains fragile.
Leaders are assassinated.
Countries are referred to the international criminal court
at will, and food security is still an issue.
We eat chickens without knowing where their thighs come from.
How can a continent with vast lakes, rivers,
and natural resources still face food insecurity?
The path we've been on has been the wrong one.
So where do we go from here?
How will we manage?
There's no clear path forward.
All the old ways have been worn out.
Today, in the world dominated by Europe,
by the powerful, you need to be strong.
If you're weak or vulnerable,
friendship doesn't count.
You get crushed when the time comes.
Europe does not tolerate weakness or powerlessness.
They used to dismiss China, calling things Chinese trinkets.
But now that China is strong, they've stopped saying that.
Instead, they now engage in business with China.
There's no talk of trinkets anymore
because China has power.
There are no true friendships or partnerships.
This idea of partners that Africa clings to is a myth.
Who are Germany's partners?
They handle things on their own.
Who partners with France, the UK, or the United States?
Even China doesn't rely on such partnerships.
But in Africa, we keep saying, I have a project.
Let's get funding from donors and partners.
Who funds France?
France has been in deficit for 30 years.
But they aren't asking for aid.
Who funds Germany?
Do they wait for Italy or Greece to finance their projects?
Of course not.
Africa still believes in myths like donors and partners.
But all the old models have been exhausted.
We've tried everything.
Another national conference joining another organization.
It's all been done before.
And it doesn't work.
Countries are becoming more disoriented.
What's needed now is a complete change.
A shift toward building a new system.
Create a political party.
Make the Congress a political party.
And appoint Madame Sankara as the head.
Why not?
Take the United States as an example.
Simon Bolivar wanted a United South America,
but the nations refused.
And now they remain poor, despite their resources.
Look at how the US was founded.
Benjamin Franklin was 80 years old,
while Washington, who would become the first president,
was around 50.
Many of the leaders like Madison and Hamilton
were young, 30 to 33 years old.
They didn't hesitate.
They simply created the United States,
even with doubts about corruption or the timing.
They didn't wait for perfection.
They acted and became a world power.
Some states initially resisted, like Georgia and Florida.
But now they would never ask to leave the US.
If you create a United States of Africa,
you won't be building small projects anymore.
You'll launch major initiatives to feed the population
and develop large-scale industries,
from fisheries to agriculture across the continent,
from Dakar to Namibia.
Africa has the resources to become a great power,
but it requires a complete change in thinking.
We have African elites, lawyers, doctors, engineers,
experts in every field.
We can build powerful institutions, universities,
science centers, and more.
But if we remain weak, we'll continue to be crushed.
Strength is needed, and that comes from unity and ambition.
We've already had a president of the United States of Africa.
Marcus Garvey declared himself as such.
The next leader would only be the second.
Our task now, especially for the younger generation,
is to create the conditions for Africa
to be strong and powerful.
If we remain weak, we'll continue to be exploited.
This talk of globalization and world unity is misleading.
Globalization is about economic interests,
and if you're not strong, you're simply being exploited.
Your oil, timber, fish, everything gets taken.
What kind of globalization is that?
In a so-called global village, who's the village chief?
It's certainly not us.
We're being fed with illusions, but we need to wake up.
It's time for a radical shift.
The African Union, as it exists today, is ineffective.
It's financed by Brussels.
And when someone pays your bills, they control your agenda.
You can't speak about certain issues, like San Quirá or Gabon.
What kind of representation is that for Africa?
In 50 or 60 years, nothing has worked.
All the old paths have failed.
We need a complete overhaul, a continental African
federation with real power.
It's time for us to create our future,
to build something new, and ensure that Africa becomes strong
and prosperous.
Otherwise, we'll remain stuck repeating the same mistakes.
This is almost a form of political deception.
While we wait, if we can, we should focus
on large pan-African projects.
This is why I'm trying to convince the political leaders
in my country to create what I'd call
the largest university on the African continent.
There's space, there's money, and there's youth.
So let's build it.
A grand university where everything is taught,
from cooking to space exploration,
at the very least we can do this.
Until the lions have their own historians,
the tales of the hunt will always glorify the hunter.
