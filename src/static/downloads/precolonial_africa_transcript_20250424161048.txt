What if I told you the version of history we have been taught is incomplete?
What if the land we often see young in stories of struggle by arms home to kings, queens, scholars and empires
at rival and even surpass the greatest powers of the world?
Africa is not just a land of poverty or conflict, it's a land of origin, of innovation and of legacy.
Before colonizer set foot on its shores, before the transatlantic slave trade taught through its heart,
there was life here, there was power, there was civilization, and today with the order of story.
For far too long, Africa has been portrayed as a continent without history,
as if it began only with slavery and colonialism, while that narrative is false.
Africa's history is vast, rich and powerful, yet many know more about Europe, Asia and the Americas.
It's time we change that.
Some of the greatest civilizations in the world history tried here, on African soil.
In the 1500s and earlier, African societies revived organized and connected to global trading networks,
even engaging in trans-oceanic travel, a trillion gold salts, taxas and knowledge.
Yes, knowledge. As an African proverb reminds us onto the lion's
lands to write, every story would glorify the hunter. Well, yeah, it's a lion's story.
In the early empire founded by King Sundayatakita, a one-odd ritualization of the West Africa,
it had strong systems of law and order, advanced agriculture, human mining industries,
and the latest library in Africa. And of course, it was home to Monsamusa,
the Redess Man, and record that history. As it speaks,
while in the supplied nearly half of the world's gold, and held over a million manuscripts,
proving that academia, under continent, didn't begin with colonialism. It was born here.
Father East, in what is now modern days Sudan, was a kingdom of Kush,
part of Asian Luba, sophisticated cosmopolitan strategic,
Luba was the major hope for trade between Africa, the Arabian desert, and the Mediterranean world.
From say about Luba, come from me, the Asian Tiktoksian world for gold.
Before money, there was what God do in life, also known as Kingdom of Ghana.
It started on the Transaharan 3-grute, linking African interior societies to Mediterranean markets.
Here were especially known for trading gold and cola notes.
Polar notes were later used as a secret ingredient in the making of Coca-Cola.
In the 10th century, the Kingdom of Ghana was absorbed into the rising of the Malian empire,
but it's legacy and the earth.
In the not, the Amohad empire, a powerful Morish dynasty, ruled much of North Africa,
and even extended into South-Hansi, where the Udhas, philosopher,
warriors, sons of the Athosians, and religion across the two continents.
Now let's head over to being founded by the groups,
picking people.
World meaning came from the Portuguese, means pronunciation of the Ubelli.
It termed meaning land or bitterness.
Benin had started as close stars of hunter-gatherer villages,
but by 1300s, there was a Boston center for trade and incredible art.
Benin bronzes, masterpiece, middle brass, bronze, and cobra.
Our world renowned today.
Unfortunately, many were looted during the British expedition in 1897.
Over 6000 pieces to them, some now sold for millions.
One alone fetched a $10.5 million in 2015.
But there's more.
In the 11th century, Benin built a 16,000 km long wall.
The Lajets man made structure on earth at that time, but ruled by royal husband,
it was a symbol of might and other.
The next time someone acts here about African history,
tell them about Mali, tell them about Kush, Ghana,
Amohar and Benin.
Because Africa's story did not begin with colonization.
It began with kings, scholars, at its tempi and majesty.
This is just a glimpse of what was and what still can be.
Africa is not history waiting to be written.
It's a history that has been buried waiting to be remembered.
In the ruins of great cities and the pages of stolen manuscripts,
but in the memories of the descendants, the truth lives on.
To know where we are going, we must first know where we came from.
So we keep learning.
Keep questioning, keep sharing stories,
at our own silenced.
Because when the lion writes its story, the world listens.
The lion's story is a story that is not a story.
But it is a story that is not a story.
It is a story that is not a story.
It is a story that is not a story.
It is a story that is not a story.
It is a story that is not a story.
It is a story that is not a story.
It is a story that is not a story.
It is a story that is not a story.
It is a story that is not a story.
It is a story that is not a story.
It is a story that is not a story.
It is a story that is not a story.
It is a story that is not a story.
